# Day-Planner

Description:
For this project we were tasks with creating a work day planner. This planner starts at 9:00 AM and goes through to 5:00 PM. It also has the current date at the top of the page.

Each row of the day planner is dynamic and will display as a different color based on what time it is. The current hour displays as a light orange color, hours in the past are a light green and hours in the future are a light gray.

Also all the rows allow the user to enter text content and have a save button next to each row.
